                <p>Born in Omaha, Nebraska on September 30 to Dan and Sharon Donehey, Mike had grown up in a Christian home. He enjoyed soccer and other sports, but surprisingly didn’t pursue much of a musical career. Being the middle of 5 kids, Donehey has always been used to having company around.
                Attending Fredericksburg Christian School in Fredericksburg, VA, Mike starred on the soccer team for the class of 1999. On September 17, 1998, Donehey and two teammates were driving to a game when the Honda they were in swerved out of control on Mine Road near Spotsylvania County. The car flipped several times before smashing into a tree and erupting into chaos.<br>

                When police and paramedics arrived on the scene, they thought Donehey was dead. What they later came to understand was that sometime between the swerving and crashing, Mike and his friends were thrown out of the car and ejected onto the ground. His dad, Dan Donehey, reports that paramedics lost Donehey’s pulse more than once on the way to the hospital. The injuries experienced were tremendous; not only did he fracture his skull and vertebrae, but Mike needed 96 stitches. After 5 days in intensive care, he was told he would never walk again. “It kind of woke me up to the realization that I am not immortal, that I am not going to be here forever,” says Donehey.<br>

                Two months after the crash, Mike proved science wrong when he was up and moving, eager to play in the school’s soccer championships. While recovering from the crash, Mike picked up the guitar – and almost never put it down. “I remember him being annoying with it. We were like, ‘Dude! Stop playing the guitar!’” says childhood friend Will Newman. Having no plans to pursue music as a career, Mike continued along the path of majoring in Theater in college.<br>

                “At college, I experienced a lot of frustration because things weren’t working out the way they were supposed to with my acting,” recalls Donehey. After constantly taking second place at auditions, he met fellow musicians Brian Homan and Jason Jamison, who he admired because “they sang about just wanting to be with Jesus.” Soon after, Fraggle Rock was formed, and later changed to Tenth Avenue North.

                Mike currently lives in Nashville, TN with his wife, Kelly, and daughters, Eisley, Nora and June.<br>

                <p>Jeff Owen, lead guitarist for Tenth Avenue North, was born in Anderson, Indiana to parents Sungcha and Tom Owen on June 28, 1983. Growing up with his brother, Robbie, Jeff and his family attended the East Side Church of God throughout his childhood. He was still in high school when the basis of Tenth Avenue North, then called Fraggle Rock, was formed. After graduating from Highland High School in 2001, Owen attended local college at Anderson University. In 2004, he moved down to Florida to extend his education. While volunteering at a church called Christ Fellowship, (where Tenth Avenue North was currently playing), and working a side job at Starbucks, Jeff was approached by the lead singer of the band, Mike Donehey, and asked if he would like to join them. He had filled in for Tenth Avenue North on bass during a previous summer, so he was eager to accept the offer.<br>

                Two days later, Jeff received a call from singer Joy Williams offering a chance to tour along with her, and politely rejected the offer made by Tenth Avenue North. It wasn’t until the next year that Owen would claim his position as lead guitarist for the band. Jeff later met his wife, Heather, when she was working at their record label. When being asked if it was love at first sight, Jeff responds, “If you asked her, the answer is no. We were friends for a year, and I tried to date her, but she said no. I was bummed out and a couple of months later, I wasn’t going to take no as an answer. I came back on full force and she eventually caved.”<br>

                Jeff has since continued his work with Tenth Avenue North on lead guitar. He currently lives in Nashville, TN with his wife, Heather, and children, Simon and Penny.<br>

              <p>Q: What was your first job? <br>

                A: One of my first jobs was being a door to door vacuum salesman. Literally had to lug around 50lb vacuums all day and would try to convince people that spending several thousands of dollars on one was a good idea. I eventually quit on morals alone. If you’re reading this and you bought one from me back then, I sincerely apologize. But I bet your carpet looks immaculate!<br>

                Q: If you weren’t a musician, what would you be?<br>

                A: One of my goals after playing music is to become a Maximized Living Chiropractor (scripturally based naturopathic doctor of chiropractic).<br>

                Q: Did you go to college, if so, where and for what?<br>

                A: I studied music at the University of Texas (UTSA).<br>

                Q: Do you have any pets?<br>

                A: Brendon, our keyboard player, is as loyal as a pet. Every time I walk in the room he acts very excited, like he hasn’t seen me in years. It’s pretty great.<br>

                Q: Name some of your musical influences.<br>

                A: Anything that cooks really. Currently influencing me is lots of Motown music and The Wonder Years theme song.<br>

                Q: What’s your favorite ice cream flavor?<br>

                A: Cookies ‘n cream is my ultimate weakness.<br>

                Q: Describe your most embarrassing moment on stage.<br>

                A: Most of them involve or are caused by Mike, our lead singer. And most of which are too unintentionally inappropriate to answer.<br>

                Q: What are some of your favorite movies?<br>

                A: I really love a good comic book movie. Ironman is my favorite avenger.<br>

                Q: If you were a superhero, what would your name be?<br>

                A: Not sure of my name, but my power would definitely involve making plates of delicious Mexican food appear whenever I wanted. Thousands would be fed. Like Jesus and the five loaves and two fish. Except people would be eating never-ending guac and freshly prepared organic chips and salsa.<br>

                Q: Anything else to add?<br>

                A: Remember the Alamo.</p>
